In the Week5 of Data Mining Class I started understanding about Naive Bayes and K-nearest neighbors I have first manually calculated the predections using the Naive Bayes Model refereing to the spam_worksheet dataset. Later used the Jupyter Notebook to build a Naive Bayes and KNN classifier I used the same dataset spam_worksheet dataset.

I have built the ROC curve and AUC score using Naive Bayes classifier and KNN classifier I have split the data into training and testing sets
